 1. What do you know about sets?
 a. {1,2} ! {2,3} =  b. {1,2} !
 {2,3} = c.  True
 or False
: {{1,2}, {3}, {4,5}} is a partition of {1,2,3,4,5} 

 2. How many 
solutions are there to the equation x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 17, where x1, x2, x3, 
x4 are non
-negative integers?
 
 3. How many different ways are there to choose a dozen donuts from the 21 varieties at a 
donut shop? 
 
 7. A seed randomly blows around a complex habitat. It may land on any of three 
different soil types: a high
-qualit
y soil that gives a 0.8 chance of seed survival, a 
medium
-quality soil that gives a 0.3 chance of survival, and a low
-quality soil that 
gives only a 0.1 chance of survival. These three soil types (high, medium, and low) 
are present in the habitat in propor
tions of 30:20:50, respectively. The probability that 
a seed lands on a particular soil type is proportional to the frequency of that type in 
the habitat. Draw the probability tree. 
  a) What is the probability that the seed lands in a low
-quality habitat and
 survives?
 b) What is the probability of survival of the seed, assuming it lands?
 c) If you know that a seed survived, what is the probability that it landed in a low
-quality environment?

 1. Suppose an individual applying to a college determines that he has an 80% chance of 
being accepted, and he knows that dormitory housing will only be provided for 60% 
of all of the accepted students. 
What is
 the probability of the student being accepted 
and
 receiving dormitory housing.

 6. Given 
P(A) = 0.55, P(Bc) = 0.35, and 
P(A ! B) = 0.75, find
 P(B) and

 B). 
 5. In #4
, what if two of the men are feuding and refuse to serve on the committee together?
 
 6. Suppose a box contains four tickets labeled 112, 121, 211, 222. We choose a ticket at 
random and consider the following events:
  Ai ={1 occurs at the 
ith place}
 for 
i = 1, 2, 3
  Are A
1, A2, and A
3 pairwise independent? Are they mutually independent?

 3. An hexadecimal
 number is a number whose digits can take sixteen different values: either 
one of the ten numbers from 0 to 9, or one of the six letters from A to F. How many 
different 8
-digit hexadecimal numbers are there, if an hexadecimal number is allowed to 
begin wit
h any number of zeros?
